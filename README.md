**Overview**

This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU supports various arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations as selected by a 4-bit control signal (ALU_Sel). The output of the ALU is a 9-bit result to accommodate operations such as addition and subtraction that may generate carry or borrow bits.
